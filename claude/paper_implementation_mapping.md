# BeyondMimic Paper to Implementation Mapping

## Paper Overview (arXiv:2508.08241)

Based on the abstract, BeyondMimic appears to focus on:
1. **Learning skills from human motions** for humanoid control
2. **Guided diffusion approach** for versatile motion generation
3. **Two key challenges** addressed in humanoid motion control
4. **Motion tracking pipeline** for dynamic skills
5. **Unified diffusion policy** for zero-shot task control
6. **Capabilities**: waypoint navigation, obstacle avoidance

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Motion Tracking Framework (Implemented)

The repository implements a comprehensive motion tracking system based on DeepMimic-style rewards:

**Paper Concept â†’ Code Implementation:**
- Motion tracking pipeline â†’ `source/whole_body_tracking/whole_body_tracking/tasks/tracking/`
- Dynamic skills learning â†’ PPO training with domain randomization
- Human motion data â†’ LAFAN1 dataset integration via WandB registry

**Key Files:**
- `mdp/commands.py`: Motion loading and command generation
- `mdp/rewards.py`: DeepMimic reward functions (exponential kernels)
- `mdp/observations.py`: State representation for policy
- `tracking_env_cfg.py`: Environment configuration

### 2. Reward Function Architecture

**DeepMimic-Style Tracking (Fully Implemented):**
```python
# In rewards.py - Exponential reward kernels
r = exp(-errorÂ² / ÏƒÂ²)
```

Tracking components:
- Anchor position/orientation tracking (Ïƒ=0.3/0.4)
- Relative body positions/orientations (Ïƒ=0.3/0.4)
- Linear/angular velocities (Ïƒ=1.0/Ï€)
- Regularization terms (action rate, joint limits, contacts)

### 3. Anchor-Based Coordinate System

**Innovation in Implementation:**
- Anchor body (typically torso) serves as reference frame
- All body positions computed relative to anchor
- Enables position-invariant tracking
- Yaw-only alignment preserves dynamics

Code location: `commands.py:116-130` (anchor properties)

### 4. Domain Randomization

**Sim-to-Real Transfer (Implemented):**
- Physics randomization (friction, restitution)
- Initial state randomization (phase sampling)
- Push forces (every 1-3 seconds)
- Joint position perturbations

Code location: `mdp/events.py`

### 5. PPO Training Configuration

**Hyperparameters (Implemented):**
- Network: [512, 256, 128] hidden units
- Learning rate: 1e-3 with adaptive scheduling
- Batch size: 4096 environments
- Rollout: 24 steps
- GAE: Î³=0.99, Î»=0.95

Code location: `config/g1/agents/rsl_rl_ppo_cfg.py`

## Missing/Future Components (Based on Paper Abstract)

### 1. Guided Diffusion Policy (Not Yet Implemented)

The paper mentions a "unified diffusion policy" for versatile control, but the current implementation uses PPO. This suggests:

**Potential Future Work:**
- Diffusion model for motion generation
- Conditional generation based on task objectives
- Zero-shot transfer to new tasks

**Expected Implementation:**
- New policy class extending current PPO
- Diffusion training loop
- Conditional inputs for task specification

### 2. Task-Oriented Control (Partially Implemented)

The paper mentions capabilities like:
- **Waypoint navigation** â†’ Not found in current code
- **Obstacle avoidance** â†’ Not found in current code
- **Zero-shot task control** â†’ Not implemented

These would likely require:
- Additional observation space for task specification
- Modified reward functions for task objectives
- Possibly a hierarchical control structure

### 3. Adaptive Sampling (Under Development)

Found commented code suggesting work in progress:
- Dynamic phase sampling based on tracking difficulty
- Currently has numerical stability issues
- Located in `commands.py` (commented sections)
