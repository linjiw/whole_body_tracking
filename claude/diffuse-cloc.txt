diffusion models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning, they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast,
recent diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating
physically realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction
limits their steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a
key insight: modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a
single diffusion model makes action generation steerable by conditioning
it on the predicted states. This approach allows us to leverage established
conditioning techniques from kinematic motion generation while producing
physically realistic motions. As a result, we achieve planning capabilities
without the need for a high-level planner. Our method handles a diverse set of
unseen long-horizon downstream tasks through a single pre-trained model,
including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, motion in-betweening, and
task-space control. Experimental results show that our method significantly
outperforms the traditional hierarchical framework of high-level motion
diffusion and low-level tracking.

1 INTRODUCTION
The goal of physics-based character animation has long been the
synthesis of dynamically realistic motions that can both react to its
environment and respond to precise user control. Such capabilities
have broad applications across gaming, virtual/augmented reality,
and robotics.
Recent advances in kinematic motion diffusion models have shown
promise in motion synthesis through conditioning on partial states [Shi
et al. 2024], text [Tevet et al. 2023], and music [Tseng et al. 2023].
Furthermore, the same kinematics motion diffusion model can be
reused on unseen downstream tasks via inference-time conditioning
such as classifier-guidance or inpainting [Cohan et al. 2024; Karunratanakul et al. 2023]. Yet, these approaches fall short of achieving
physical realism. To improve physical consistency, a tracking policy can be used to follow the kinematics motions, but ensuring
robustness to domain shifts introduced by the kinematics generation remains a challenge. On the other hand, prior works [Chi
et al. 2023; Huang et al. 2024a; Truong et al. 2024] have focused on
predicting actions, ensuring physical realism without requiring extra components. However, unlike kinematic-based diffusion models,
these approaches cannot adapt to unseen downstream tasks without
retraining, as inference-time conditioning techniques are infeasible
due to the lack of direct comparability between goals defined in
state space and synthesized action trajectories.
To bridge the gap between kinematic motion diffusion and action
diffusion models, we propose Diffuse-CLoC, a diffusion model designed for flexible guidance in physics-based look-ahead control.
Our goal is to train an end-to-end state-action diffusion model capable of addressing a wide range of unseen, long-horizon downstream
tasks for a physics-based character, without the need for retraining.
Our primary insight lies in modeling the joint distribution of states
and actions within a single diffusion model, which enables action
generation to be conditioned on the predicted states. Building on
this insight, we develop a transformer-based diffusion architecture
and an attention mechanism that includes non-causal attention for
states and causal attention for actions. We further introduce a rolling
scheme inspired by [Zhang et al. 2024] to improve consistency and
speed in auto-regressive policy execution. Ultimately, Diffuse-CLoC
enables the application of established techniques from kinematic
motion generation, such as classifier guidance, to perform multiple
unseen downstream tasks with physics-based characters, including
waypoint navigation, dynamic obstacle avoidance such as other
characters, and dynamic maneuvers like jumping over obstacles
and crawling underneath them, as well as inpainting for motion
in-betweening task (Fig. 1). Our primary contributions include:
• A method for training and guiding a diffusion-based policy that
enables the completion of multiple unseen downstream tasks in
physics-based character control without requiring task-specific
fine-tuning or a high-level planner.
• A novel architecture and attention setup to model the joint
distribution of states and actions, allowing conditional action
generation via steerable motion synthesis.
• An optimized rolling inference scheme for auto-regressive action generation, enabling interactive execution of agile motions,
significantly improving consistency and speed.
2 RELATED WORK
This section reviews recent advancements across several domains
relevant to our approach, including physics-based character animation, diffusion in physics-based control, steering motion synthesis,
and inference consistency and speed. An overview of prior works
in diffusion based methods are shown in Fig. 2.
2.1 Physics-Based Character Animation
Early physics-based character animation focused on tracking single
motion trajectories [Peng et al. 2018]. Subsequent work expanded
this to capture motion distributions, such as AMP [Peng et al. 2021],
though these approaches faced challenges in training stability and
were limited to small datasets. As an alternative, latent skill embeddings were introduced, leveraging a VAE trained on large datasets
[Won et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2022, 2024; Zhu et al. 2023], which can
also be paired with a high-level controller to complete downstream
tasks [Peng et al. 2022; Won et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2023].
Recent motion tracking controllers [Luo et al. 2023; Serifi et al.
2024b] have achieved notable success, leading to approaches that
decompose the problem into two parts: a kinematic motion synthesis model and a universal tracking controller for the synthesized

category are [Ajay et al. 2023; Tevet et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2023]. (b) The model-free approach learns 𝑝 (𝑎|𝑠 ) only and does not allow inference-time planning

motion [Tevet et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2023]. However, the tracking
controller’s performance heavily depends on the quality of the kinematic trajectory, which can include artifacts like floating bodies,
foot sliding, and penetration.
To address this challenge, RobotMDM [Serifi et al. 2024a] fine-tunes
a motion diffusion model using the value function of an RL tracker
to produce more trackable motions. Similarly, [Han et al. 2024;
Li et al. 2024a] refine diffusion models directly with PPO-based
reinforcement learning guided by an RL tracker’s reward. Other
methods instead fine-tune the tracking controller to handle artifacts
created by the diffusion model [Tevet et al. 2024].
Despite these advancements, trackers are often sensitive to out
of distribution motions and require task-specific fine-tuning for
applications like object interaction [Tevet et al. 2024]. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that even minor classifier guidance on kinematic
trajectories can hurt the robustness of general tracking controllers.
2.2 Diffusion in Physics-based Control
Diffusion policies have been successfully applied in character animation [Truong et al. 2024], manipulation [Chi et al. 2023], and
locomotion [Huang et al. 2024a; Mothish et al. 2024] domains. However, its action-only generation makes inference-time conditioning
impractical. In contrast, Diffuser [Janner et al. 2022] diffuses both
states and actions, enabling classifier guidance through a reward
formulation though exhibits limited robustness [Chen et al. 2024].
Decision Diffuser [Ajay et al. 2023] improves robustness by similarly diffusing both states and actions, but discards actions during
inference, relying instead on a trained inverse dynamics model. In
contrast, our method enables both intuitive guidance directly in
state space and high-quality conditional generation in action space.
2.3 Steering Motion Synthesis
This section discusses common methods for steering motion synthesis, enabling pretrained models to be re-used for novel downstream
tasks. Each approach provides a unique mechanism to align the
generative process with task-specific requirements or constraints.
Classifier-free guidance enhances sample quality and control by
interpolating between an unconditional and a conditional model
during the generation process, without requiring an explicit classifier [Ho and Salimans 2021]. In character animation, this method
has been used to synthesize motions with text conditioning [Tevet
et al. 2023; Truong et al. 2024]. However, the conditioning signals
must be specified during training, and the model must be re-trained
for any new conditioning signals.
Classifier guidance incorporates conditional information after the
training phase by utilizing the gradient of a pre-trained classifier
[Dhariwal and Nichol 2024] or cost function [Carvalho et al. 2023].
This technique guides the diffusion model’s generative process,
steering outputs toward the desired class or minimizing the loss. In
character animation, it allows a single pre-trained kinematics model
to address multiple downstream tasks, such as obstacle avoidance
and reaching [Janner et al. 2022; Karunratanakul et al. 2023]. Despite its success, classifier guidance has not yet been explored for
dynamic tasks in underactuated robotic systems, such as physicsbased character animation.
Inpainting involves generating or reconstructing missing regions
of the original signal by conditioning the diffusion process on the
surrounding known context. In character animation, this technique
is useful for generating trajectories with partially known states,
such as root trajectories [Karunratanakul et al. 2023] or a set of
desired joint trajectories [Tseng et al. 2023].
Reinforcement learning has been employed as a high level planner
to direct the diffusion process for downstream tasks [Shi et al. 2024].
When future trajectory predictions are absent, a high-level planner
is essential to strategize [Shi et al. 2024]; however, our method can
plan and foresee future events, allowing the accomplishment of
downstream tasks without the need for a high-level planner.
2.4 Inference Consistency and Speed
A key challenge for generative planners is ensuring that the generated plans do not conflict during rollouts. Frequent replanning with
multimodal trajectory distributions can lead to alternating behavior
modes, negatively affecting task performance [Römer et al. 2024].
One approach is to execute a fixed action sequence before replanning
[Chi et al. 2023], but this lacks real-time state feedback, reducing
robustness. Another solution, Action Chunking [Zhao et al. 2023],
ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 44, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2025.

averages predictions over time for consistency but may yield suboptimal results by averaging dissimilar plans. Alternatively, [Römer
et al. 2024] selects the closest trajectory to the previous one but
incurs overhead from concurrently sampling multiple trajectories.
Inference speedup can be naïvely achieved by minimizing diffusion
steps at the cost of diversity, though techniques such as one-step
diffusion [Wang et al. 2024] could mitigate these tradeoffs. Hybrid methods, which pair fast architectures for initial guesses with
slower fine-tuning of models [Li et al. 2024b], balance speed and
accuracy. Rolling or streaming strategies apply noise based on temporal proximity—less for immediate actions and more for distant
ones—enabling faster generation of infinite sequences [Høeg et al.
2024; Zhang et al. 2024]. Building upon this, we find that rolling
addresses both motion consistency and speedup by maintaining
diversity for future decisions while solidifying immediate ones.
3 METHOD
We propose Diffuse-CLoC, a novel framework that allows classifier guidance and inpainting in state space to generate actions to
physically steer the character for various tasks zero-shot.
Our approach to modeling complex motion behaviors builds upon
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) [Ho et al. 2020]. At
each timestep 𝑡, our model predicts a trajectory𝝉𝑡 = [𝒂𝑡
,𝒔𝑡+1, 𝒂𝑡+1, . . . ,
𝒔𝑡+𝐻 , 𝒂𝑡+𝐻 ] that contains the current action as well as the 𝐻 steps
of state-action pairs in the future. Moreover, we let 𝑶𝑡 be the observation history of state-action pairs of length 𝑁, as well as the
current state, 𝒔𝑡
, i.e., 𝑶𝑡 = [𝒔𝑡−𝑁 , 𝒂𝑡−𝑁 , · · · ,𝒔𝑡].
We train a prediction network, 𝝉ˆ𝑡 = 𝑥0,𝜃 (𝝉
𝒌
𝑡
, 𝑶𝑡
, 𝒌) that aims to produce a clean trajectory, where 𝝉
𝒌
𝑡
is 𝝉 with added Gaussian noise
based on the noise level 𝒌. We assign independent noise levels per
timestep for states and actions along the trajectory, i.e. 𝒌 = (𝒌𝒔, 𝒌𝒂),
where 𝒌𝒔, 𝒌𝒂 ∈ R
𝑁 +𝐻+1
. We then follow Stochastic Langevin Dynamics [Welling and Teh 2011] to sample iteratively,
𝝉
𝒌−1
𝑡 = 𝛼𝒌 (𝝉
𝒌
𝑡 −𝛾𝒌𝜖𝜃
(𝝉
𝒌
𝑡
, 𝑶𝑡
, 𝒌) + N (0, 𝜎𝒌
2
𝑰)), (1)
where 𝛼𝒌,𝛾𝒌, and 𝜎𝒌 are DDPM parameters, and 𝜖𝜃
(·) =
1 √
1−𝛼𝒌
𝝉
𝒌
𝑡 −
√
𝛼𝒌 √
1−𝛼𝒌
𝑥0,𝜃 (·) is the predicted noise taken away from the noisy trajectory. Training of DDPMs is self-supervised, with 𝒌𝒔𝑖
, 𝒌𝒂𝑖 ∼ U (0, 𝐾)
sampled uniformly up to the maximum diffusion step 𝐾. We train
with the mean squared error (MSE) loss against the clean trajectory:
L = 𝑀𝑆𝐸(𝑥0,𝜃 (𝝉
𝒌
𝑡
, 𝑶𝑡
, 𝒌), 𝝉𝑡) (2)
‘
Diffusion models, though trained unconditionally, can be adapted
for conditional generation during inference. By Bayes’ rule, the
denoiser’s learned score function ∇𝝉 log 𝑝(𝝉) [Song et al. 2021] can
be extended to the conditional form ∇𝝉 log 𝑝(𝝉 | 𝝉
∗
) = ∇𝝉 log 𝑝(𝝉)+
∇𝝉 log 𝑝(𝝉
∗
| 𝝉), where 𝝉
∗
is the optimal trajectory. Given a cost
function 𝐺
𝑐
𝝉
(𝝉), we let the conditional probability of the optimal
trajectory to be 𝑝(𝝉
∗
| 𝝉) ∝ exp(−𝐺
𝑐
𝝉
(𝝉)). Then, the posterior
gradient, ∇𝝉 log 𝑝(𝝉
∗
| 𝝉) = −∇𝝉𝐺
𝑐
𝝉
(𝝉), naturally aligns with the
descending direction of the cost. This approach, formally classifier
guidance, conditions the diffuser using any cost function𝐺
𝑐
𝝉
(𝝉) with
a computable gradient ∇𝝉𝐺
𝑐
𝝉
(𝝉).
In character animation, classifier guidance is effective in kinematics
generation, where cost functions can be readily defined and computed, but not in action space. We address this limitation by a novel
co-diffusion of states and actions, allowing kinematic guidance to
effectively condition action generation for complex tasks.
3.1 Co-diffusing States and Actions
The core idea of our method is co-diffusing state and action, making
our diffusion model both an autoregressive motion generator and
a control policy. Moreover, we propose a novel transformer architecture, introducing an attention mechanism that allows guidance
to propagate from future states to current actions and a loss mask
to improve model robustness. This design simultaneously enables
long-horizon state predictions and robust actions for complex tasks.
Architecture: Diffuse-CLoC uses a decoder-only transformer architecture, as shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to Diffuser [Janner et al. 2022],
where a pair of state and action is combined into a single transformer
token, our model takes the state and action input embeddings as
separate tokens. Both the state and action tokens are concatenated
from an MLP embedding and a sinusoidal embedding of their corresponding noise levels 𝒌𝒔 and 𝒌𝒂. We use a two-layer MLP for the
state encoder and a linear layer for the action encoder. We then add
learnable positional encodings to each token. The state and action
embeddings over time are fed into a GPT-style decoder [Radford
2018], followed by layer norm and the corresponding linear layers
as output heads.
Attention: Diffuse-CLoC uses a tailored attention mask that differentiates between states and actions. Shown in Fig. 3 (Right), actions
use a causal attention mask, attending only to past states to anchor
the trajectory and filter out prediction artifacts in future states, in
addition to past actions for regularization. In contrast, states are
permitted to attend to future states, enabling future information
to backpropagate to current state. Additionally, disabling attention
from states to actions simplifies learning without compromising the
quality of kinematics prediction.
Shorter Action Horizon: Predicting long state horizons, such as
those extending to about a second, is essential for multi-modality
and long-term planning required by certain tasks, but long-term
action prediction is challenging due to increased variance [Truong
et al. 2024]. To address this, we limit the action horizon to at most
16 steps and mask long-term future actions in the loss function,
focusing on the initial actions only.
Emphasis Projection: To enhance state representation, we integrate
emphasis projection [Karunratanakul et al. 2023] to emphasize the
global states in the state space. Specifically, we define a projection
matrix 𝑷 = 𝑨𝑩, where 𝑨𝑖𝑗 ∼ N (0, 1), and 𝑩 a diagonal matrix with
entries corresponding to the global states set to 𝑐 > 1 and others to
one. Furthermore, unlike [Karunratanakul et al. 2023], sensitivity to
local states is also preserved by concatenating projected and original
states, i.e. 𝑷 = [𝑨𝑩 I].

Fig. 3. Framework of Diffuse-CLoC. The rolling scheme (Left) is implemented as a FIFO buffer, where at every timestep 𝑡, a state and action pair of pure
noise is pushed into the denoiser, while the earliest clean pair is popped out and used to step the simulator. The denoiser architecture (Middle) denoises the
buffer of states and actions with an increasing noise level along the trajectory. The observation 𝑂𝑡 is directly inpainted into the sequence, and only noisy future
predictions are denoised. Notice that noisy states and actions have different shades, meaning that their noise levels 𝒌𝒔 , 𝒌𝒂 can be different. The attention
mask (Right) shows that state attends to all past and future states but masks out all actions, while action is causal attending to previous states and actions.
3.2 Rolling Inference
During inference, we use receding horizon control and replan at
every timestep, executing only the immediate action. This approach
improves robustness over open-loop execution by allowing the
policy to adapt to the latest observations.
However, an issue in constant replanning is that planned trajectories could be inconsistent, causing oscillations. To address this issue,
we use a rolling inference scheme. While a similar technique was
introduced to generate infinite motions in kinematics space [Zhang
et al. 2024], we find it also improves the policy consistency during
autoregressive execution. A FIFO buffer assigns noise levels based
on the proximity of trajectory step to the current timestep. At each
timestep, new Gaussian noise is added to the buffer while the oldest
is removed. This approach leverages previous diffusion results for
warmup, ensuring consistency and reducing diffusion steps. Since
the the classifier guidance signal diminishes as 𝒌 → 0, we perform rolling at a higher 𝒌 for stronger guidance, while maintaining
consistency and achieving speedup.
4 APPLICATIONS
The goal of pretraining a generative controller is to handle diverse
downstream tasks. Unlike hierarchical approaches that separate
planners and tracking controllers, co-diffusing states and actions integrates planning and execution during inference through guidance
and inpainting. This approach eliminates the need for additional
components or training, resulting in a unified policy capable of
solving multiple tasks as detailed below.
4.1 Static Obstacle Avoidance
Reacting to obstacles while navigating from A to B can produce the
same behavior during inference by introducing a guidance cost that
pushes the character away from obstacles:
𝐺
obs
𝝉
(𝝉) =
∑︁
𝑗
𝑡∑︁+𝐻
𝑡
′=𝑡
exp
− 𝑐 · SDF𝑗
(𝒔𝑡
′ )

, (3)
where 𝑐 determines the safe distance and SDF𝑗
(·) is the Signed
Distance Function from the 𝑗-th obstacle. For certain obstacles, such
as a block on the ground, interaction (e.g., jumping onto it) may be
desired rather than strict avoidance. In this case, we clip the SDF
value outside the object to zero, penalizing only when the planned
trajectory penetrates the obstacle. To achieve point-goal navigation
while avoiding obstacles, the obstacle cost 𝐺
obs
𝝉
(𝝉) can be combined
with waypoint guidance, 𝐺
wp
𝝉
(𝝉) =
Í𝑡+𝐻
𝑡
′=𝑡
∥𝑃root(𝒔𝑡
′ ) − 𝑔∥
2
, where
𝑃root is the mapping from state representation to root position, and
𝑔 is the waypoint or goal location. We showcase different results
using such costs in Fig. 1, 4c, 4d, and 4e.
4.2 Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance
A more advanced obstacle avoidance task involves avoiding not only
static obstacles but also each other as dynamic obstacles. Using the
planning horizon, the obstacle avoidance cost 𝐺
obs
𝝉
can be extended
to consider distances for dynamic obstacles at each timestep:
𝐺
sa
𝝉,𝑖(𝝉) =
∑︁
𝑗≠𝑖
𝑡∑︁+𝐻
𝑡
′=𝑡
exp
− 𝑐 · ∥𝑃root(𝒔
𝑖
𝑡
′ ) − 𝑃root(𝒔
𝑗
𝑡
′ ) ∥2

, (4)
where 𝐺
sa
𝝉,𝑖 is the cost for the 𝑖-th character and 𝑠
𝑗
𝑡
′
is the state of the
𝑗-th character at timestep 𝑡
′
. Fig. 1 shows an example of characters
navigating through a forest of pillars while avoiding each other.
This formulation allows characters to generate smooth trajectories
that avoid collisions and pass each other seamlessly.
4.3 Task Space Control
Another challenging task is conditioning on target states for specific
joints at arbitrary future timesteps within the planning horizon. This
problem can be tackled using classifier guidance,
𝐺
ts
𝝉
(𝝉) =
∑︁
𝑡
′∈𝑇
∥𝑃𝑥 (𝒔𝑡
′ ) − 𝑔𝑡
′ ∥
2
, (5)
where 𝑇 is the set of keyframe timesteps, and 𝑔𝑡
′ represents the
target at 𝑡
′
. 𝑃𝑥 (·) is the mapping from state representation to the
task space, such as the root and end-effector positions, velocities, or
combinations of them. In this work, we show the following tasks:
Root Path Following: Setting the root position as the task space
and specifying the target, 𝑔, as the desired root position along the

path ensures precise root path tracking. Fig. 4b shows a character
following an "S" shaped path while switching across styles.
Reaching: Setting one body part as the task space allows the character to generate motions to reach a target 𝑔 using dataset motions as
shown in Fig. 4a.
Gamepad Controller Steering: Shown in Fig. 1, setting the root’s
velocity, heading, and height as the task space, with 𝑔 from gamepad
inputs, enables real-time character steering.
4.4 Motion In-Betweening
In this task, the policy generates dense trajectories between a set of
desired keyframes. With sparse keyframes, inpainting often struggles to differentiate clean from noisy states. While previous methods
rely on extra masking to label these states [Cohan et al. 2024], our
approach, shown in Fig. 1, can explicitly set the inpainted states to
zero noise, naturally differentiating them from other noisy states.
𝒔𝑡 = 𝒔ˆ𝑡
, 𝒌𝒔𝑡 = 0, ∀𝑡 ∈ 𝑇 , (6)
where 𝒔ˆ𝑡 represents keyframe states, 𝒌𝒔𝑡
is the noise level at timestep
𝑡, and 𝑇 is the set of keyframe timesteps.
5 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We evaluate our method in two sections. First, we perform a comparative analysis with conventional hierarchical kinematics-tracking
frameworks on various downstream tasks. Second, we ablate on key
architectural components to validate our design choices.
5.1 Data
We use a subset of AMASS [Mahmood et al. 2019], comprising 54
motions of walking, running, crawling, and jumping. To track these
motions and collect state-action pairs, we employ PHC+ [Luo et al.
2024] as our motion tracking controller. For each motion, we collect
on average 40 rollouts (≈ 3.5 hours). Following [Truong et al. 2024],
we inject action noise during rollout to perturb the state and collect
corrective actions. The state and action definitions are as follows:
State. We use the SMPL skeleton from [Luo et al. 2023], with 𝐽 = 23
spherical joints. The overall state vector is 165-dimensional, consisting of Global and Local states defined as the following:
• Global States: root states including position (R
3
), linear velocity (R
3
), and rotation (R
3
) represented as rotation vectors, as
in [Zhang et al. 2023]. These values are expressed relative to the
character frame at the current timestep.
• Local States: joint states including Cartesian positions (R
3𝐽
),
linear velocities (R
3𝐽
), and rotations of hands and ankles (R
3×4
)
also represented as rotation vectors. These quantities are expressed relative to the character frame at each timestep.
Action. The action space is a 69-dimensional vector, representing
the target joint positions (R
3𝐽
) for the joint PD controller.
5.2 Experiment Setup
We train Diffuse-CLoC using an observation history of 𝑁 = 4(≈
0.13𝑠) and predict future states for 𝐻 = 32(≈ 1𝑠). We limit the
action horizon to 16 steps. The model employs a transformer decoder
with 6 layers, 8 heads, 512-dimensional embedding, totaling 19.95𝑀
parameters and requiring approximately 1 GB of GPU memory for
inference. Training is conducted with 20 denoising steps and an
attention dropout rate of 𝑝 = 0.3
We optimize using AdamW with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4
, weight
decay of 1×10−3
, a 10,000-step warmup phase, and a cosine learning
rate schedule. For proper guidance strength, we include state rolling
at a noise level of 14, and action rolling at a noise level of 4. We
train on a single Nvidia A100 GPU for 1,000 epochs ( 24 hours).
Inference time is gathered on a Nvidia RTX 4060 GPU with TensorRT
acceleration.
5.2.1 Task & Metrics. We evaluate our method across four tasks:
• Walk-Perturb: We apply an instantaneous perturbation force
sampled between 0 to 3000N every second during a 30s walk.
We assess fall rate and motion quality using FID.
• Forest: We randomly place 15 cylinder pillars in an 8 m × 9 m
area. The character navigates to a target point on the other side,
with success rate and traversal time as metrics.
• Jump: We randomly place a 0.3-0.5 m tall box obstacle 1-2 m in
front of the character. We measure success rate for clearing the
obstacle without falling.
• Motion In-Betweening: We generate keyframes by randomly
concatenating (without interpolating) three training motions,
sampling three keyframes from each at 1-second intervals, and
measure fall rate, mean keyframe root error (MRPE), and mean
keyframe joint position error (MJPE).
For all tasks, a fall is determined if head height drops below 0.2 m.
5.2.2 Baseline. The baseline we compare against represents the
category of methods that tracks a diffused kinematic trajectory.
For the kinematics component, we train a diffusion model similar
to the motion generation model in Guided-MDM [Karunratanakul
et al. 2023], and for tracking we use PHC+ [Luo et al. 2024] . Since
replanning frequency is a key design consideration in hierarchical
approaches, we evaluate this baseline (Kin+PHC) across various
replanning frequencies.
5.2.3 Ablation. We ablate over critical design choices, including
prediction horizon for both state and action, as well as the number of
diffusion steps. We also compare different attention schemes, including full attention, which enables unrestricted attention between all
states and actions, and diffuser attention, which restricts attention
to each token and its adjacent steps, following [Janner et al. 2022].
5.3 Comparing Kinematics + Tracking
We compare Kin+PHC with Diffuse-CLoC across four tasks, finding
that Diffuse-CLoC consistently outperforms all baseline variants
(Table 1). Kin+PHC exhibits a trade-off between motion quality and
task success: slower replan frequencies improve motion smoothness
(e.g., FID improves from 0.185 at 1-step replan to 0.038 at 32-step
replan in the walk+perturb task) but fails to adapt to abrupt state
changes. This results in a higher fall rate, which increases from 30%

at 1-step to 44% at 32-step intervals. In contrast, Diffuse-CLoC maintains low FID (0.074) and reduces the fall rate to 16%, demonstrating
robust performance with plausible motion quality.
Kin+PHC’s performance also depends heavily on the kinematic planner aligning with the RL tracker’s learned distribution, which is vulnerable to inference-time conditioning. In the jump task, Kin+PHC
achieves only 22% success at 16-step intervals, as obstacle avoidance
guidance generates trajectories outside the tracker’s capabilities.
Similarly, in motion in-betweening, Kin+PHC exhibits higher fall
rates (66% at 1-step) and less precise motion (MJPE 0.2, MRPE 0.985).
In contrast, Diffuse-CLoC achieves 71% success in jump and reduces
fall rates to 31% with lower MJPE (0.116) and MRPE (0.322).
Unlike Kin+PHC, Diffuse-CLoC uses the joint distribution of states
and actions, allowing it to fit over the entire horizon to generate dynamically feasible actions, even with partially corrupted kinematic
inputs. By avoiding strict state tracking, Diffuse-CLoC reduces the
infeasible motions from classifier guidance, as shown in Fig. 5.
5.4 Effect of Prediction Horizon
The planning horizon significantly impacts the performance of
Diffuse-CLoC (Table 2), similar to its effect on conventional planning algorithms, where complex tasks require a sufficiently long
planning horizon. With a shorter horizon of 16 timesteps (≈ 0.5s),
the policy lacks foresight and struggles with forest navigation and
complex maneuvers (squatting and jumping), leading to poor success rates. In contrast, extending the horizon to 32 timesteps (≈ 1s)
dramatically improves performance, with forest navigation success
at 96% and jumping tasks at 71%. Fig. 6 highlights this comparison
visually: a 0.5s horizon results in circular or stuck behaviors, as
the short-sighted policy fails to make progress through the forest,
while a 1s horizon enables successful task completion with diverse
and adaptive solution paths that navigate around obstacles effectively. However, extending the horizon to 2s reduces performance,
as increased long-term prediction variance causes the policy to
overcommit to suboptimal trajectories. As uncertainty decreases
near obstacles, the policy recognizes the suboptimality but lacks
flexibility to adjust.
In contrast, a moderate action length improves action quality in
agile motions like jumping. While one-step predictions cause jitter, longer predictions face higher future variance. Nevertheless,
codiffusing states and actions allows it to leverage the lower state

In general, 32 state predictions combined with 16 action predictions
yield optimal performance across our evaluation tasks.
5.5 Effect of Different Attention Schemes
The attention mechanism plays a critical role in enhancing policy robustness. To ensure the plan is effectively followed, actions
should be influenced by anticipated future conditions. We evaluated
different attention schemes to assess their impact on performance.
Full Attention. Allowing actions to directly attend to future states
(full attention) decreases success rates (Table 2). This decrease is due
to two factors: (1) future states often include artifacts, and (2) due

to the rolling scheme, future states tend to be noisier, making direct
attention to future states unreliable.
Diffuse-CLoC’s Causal Action Attention. In contrast, DiffuseCLoC adopts causal attention, restricting focus to current and past
states and actions. Future states still indirectly influence actions
by propagating their effects to the current state, 𝑠0. This approach
avoids the noise and artifacts associated with direct future state
attention. As shown in Fig. 7, 𝑠0 attends more strongly to past states
than to future predictions, prioritizing dependable information and
improving generalization. This design enables Diffuse-CLoC to produce accurate and robust actions across tasks.
Diffuser’s Local Receptive Field. Diffuser [Janner et al. 2022] employs a limited receptive field, restricting attention to neighboring
states and actions. This design prevents effective propagation of
future information back to current actions, leading to poor coordination between state predictions and actions. Consequently, Diffuser
struggles with task performance, as it cannot align actions with
anticipated future conditions.
5.6 Effect of Different Rolling Schemes
Shown in Table 2, we observe a trade-off in rolling schemes across
tasks. In the jump task, disabling state rolling causes changes in the
ACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 44, No. 4, Article . Publication date: August 2025.

motion plan which disrupt the character’s momentum, leading to
lower jump heights and poor success rates. Conversely, in the forest
task, an optimal plan for the current timestep may become suboptimal as distant obstacles enter the planning horizon. Enforcing
consistency with these suboptimal plans lowers success rates and
extends completion time. Despite these trade-offs, our best model
performs robustly across scenarios with a single set of parameters.
For action rolling, the impact on performance is minimal, enabling
a 25% acceleration in the diffusion process without significant loss.
6 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we introduced Diffuse-CLoC, a guided diffusion model
for physics-based character look-ahead control. By co-diffusing a
long horizon of states and actions, our approach overcomes limitations in existing methods, such as limited steerability and physical inconsistencies in generated motions. Diffuse-CLoC employs
inference-time conditioning techniques to leverage intuitive statespace guidance for generation in action space, enabling flexible reuse
for novel downstream tasks without retraining or finetuning. Experimental results highlight its zero-shot capability to address diverse
tasks, including static and dynamic obstacle avoidance, dynamic maneuvers, and task-space control using a single model. We showcase
a long-horizon run with these diverse tasks in Fig. 8.
Despite its effectiveness, our approach has several limitations that
open directions for future research. One key challenge is tuning the
strength of classifier guidance to ensure task success while staying
within the training distribution. For some tasks, particularly those
involving jumping or crawling, overly strong guidance sometimes
led to unnatural motions or degraded quality. In these cases, increased guidance weight on obstacle clearance was necessary to
ensure successful execution. Exploring alternative guidance formulations such as using future returns instead of immediate rewards

or incorporating trust region constraints [Huang et al. 2024b] could
provide better control.
Another limitation stems from insufficient data coverage. In tasks
like hand-reaching or root path tracking, the model sometimes exhibits erroneous behaviors. For instance, jumping in place when
asked to reach overhead. This is because jumping motions are
present in the training dataset while overhead-reaching motions
are not. While additional data would help mitigate these issues, our
experiments were designed to evaluate performance under limited
coverage.
We also observed reduced motion quality in some results, such as
foot jitter. This is likely caused by torque noise added during data
augmentation. However, without this noise, diffusion fails due to
compounding errors [Truong et al. 2024]. Future work could explore

propagates this information backward for planning. Notably, future states also attend to past obstacle events to support planning. In contrast, 𝑠0, the current
state, consistently attends more strongly to past states than to future predictions, reducing the impact of artifacts from noisy future states.

alternative augmentation methods to reduce compounding errors
while improving motion smoothness.
In addition, the model’s reliance on historical observations biases it
toward previously seen motion patterns, which can limit transitions
and responsiveness, as noted in [Chen et al. 2024]. For example,
some characters in the video are not very responsive to the guided
signals in their tasks. We believe historical observations impose a
constraint on the character, making the effect of future state predictions propagate slower to affect the next action. Future work could
explore reducing this dependency.
Lastly, extending our approach to human-object interaction remains
an open challenge. Physical manipulation and contact-rich behaviors introduce complexities beyond the current framework, presenting an exciting direction for future work.
