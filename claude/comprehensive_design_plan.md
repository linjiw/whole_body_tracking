## Phase 2: Hands-On Testing Strategy (Week 2)

### 2.1 Environment Setup Validation

#### Step 1: Basic Isaac Lab Test
```bash
# Test Isaac Lab installation
python -c "import isaaclab; print(isaaclab.__version__)"

# Test GPU acceleration
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Test Isaac Sim connection
python source/whole_body_tracking/setup.py develop
```

**Expected Outcomes:**

#### Step 2: Motion Data Pipeline Test
```bash
# Test motion loading without training
python scripts/replay_npz.py \
    --registry_name test-org/wandb-registry-motions/walk \
    --headless

# Expected: Motion playback in simulator
# Validate: Joint trajectories smooth
# Check: No collision/penetration issues
```

### 2.2 Motion Mimic Training Validation

#### Progressive Testing Strategy

**Level 1: Minimal Viable Training**
```bash
# Start with single motion, few environments
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
    --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
    --num_envs=64 \
    --registry_name test-org/wandb-registry-motions/simple_walk \
    --headless \
    --max_iterations=100
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Training starts without errors
- Reward increases over iterations
- No NaN/Inf in losses
- WandB logs updating

**Level 2: Standard Training Configuration**
```bash
# Full 4096 environments, longer training
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
    --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
    --num_envs=4096 \
    --registry_name test-org/wandb-registry-motions/simple_walk \
    --headless \
    --logger wandb \
    --log_project_name motion_mimic_test \
    --run_name baseline_walk \
    --max_iterations=5000
```

**Monitoring Metrics:**
- **Tracking Rewards**: Should reach >0.8 within 2000 iterations
- **Regularization Penalties**: Should decrease over time
- **Success Rate**: Episodes completing without early termination
- **KL Divergence**: Should stay near target (0.01)

**Level 3: Complex Motion Testing**
```bash
# Test with dynamic motions (jump, spin, dance)
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py \
    --task=Tracking-Flat-G1-v0 \
    --registry_name test-org/wandb-registry-motions/jump_sequence \
    --headless \
    --logger wandb
```

**Evaluation Checkpoints:**
