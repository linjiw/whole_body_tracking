# BeyondMimic Training Workflow: Single vs Multi-Motion Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive code analysis and paper research, **BeyondMimic's current implementation supports single-motion training per instance**. Each training run focuses on learning one specific motion from the LAFAN1 dataset. The framework is architecturally designed for eventual multi-motion capabilities, but the current codebase requires one motion registry artifact per training session.

## Current Training Architecture

### 1. Single-Motion Training Pipeline

**Core Mechanism:**
```python
# From scripts/rsl_rl/train.py line 101
env_cfg.commands.motion.motion_file = str(pathlib.Path(artifact.download()) / "motion.npz")
```

**Training Workflow:**
1. **Motion Specification**: `--registry_name 16726-org/wandb-registry-Motions/{motion_name}`
2. **Artifact Download**: WandB downloads the specific motion NPZ file
3. **Environment Setup**: Single motion file loaded into `MotionLoader`
4. **Policy Training**: PPO trains policy to mimic this specific motion
5. **Specialization**: Policy becomes expert in the selected motion

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

**MotionLoader Class** (`mdp/commands.py:29-58`):
```python
def __init__(self, motion_file: str, body_indexes: Sequence[int], device: str = "cpu"):
    data = np.load(motion_file)  # Single NPZ file
    self.joint_pos = torch.tensor(data["joint_pos"], ...)
    self.body_pos_w = torch.tensor(data["body_pos_w"], ...)
    # ... loads single motion data
```

**MotionCommand Class** (`mdp/commands.py:60-296`):
- Manages reference motion playback for single motion
- Computes tracking errors relative to one motion sequence
- Handles anchor-based coordinate transformations
- Provides motion-specific observations and commands

### 3. Training Configuration

**Per-Motion Training:**
- **Environment Count**: 4096 parallel environments
- **Episode Length**: 10 seconds (500 steps @ 50Hz)
- **Training Duration**: ~10,000 iterations for convergence
- **Memory Usage**: Single motion loaded across all environments
- **Specialization**: Policy optimizes for one motion's dynamics

## Multi-Motion Capabilities: Current Status

### 1. Paper Vision vs Implementation

**Paper Goals** (from abstract and related work):
- "Scalable, high-quality motion tracking framework"
- "Moving beyond simply mimicking existing motions"
- References to multi-motion tracking in related work analysis
- "Bridge sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis"

**Current Implementation Reality:**
- Single motion file per training instance
- No built-in motion mixture or switching mechanisms
- Each policy specializes in one motion type
- Multi-motion requires separate training runs

### 2. Architecture Readiness for Multi-Motion

**Positive Indicators:**
- Modular `MotionLoader` design could be extended
- Command system abstracts motion management
- Anchor-based tracking works across motion types
- WandB registry supports multiple motion artifacts

**Required Extensions:**
- Multi-motion loader with motion selection logic
- Motion identifier in observation space
- Curriculum learning or sampling strategies
- Extended episode management for motion transitions

### 3. Current Multi-Motion Approach

**Ensemble Method (Current Practice):**
```bash
# Train separate policies for each motion
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --registry_name 16726-org/wandb-registry-Motions/walk3_subject2
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --registry_name 16726-org/wandb-registry-Motions/dance1_subject1  
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --registry_name 16726-org/wandb-registry-Motions/run1_subject2
```

**Advantages:**
- Optimal performance per motion
- Parallel training possible
- Lower complexity implementation
- Better convergence guarantees

**Disadvantages:**
- No motion transfer learning
- Storage overhead (multiple policies)
- No unified motion representation
- Deployment complexity for task switching

## Algorithm Deep Dive

### 1. BeyondMimic Core Algorithm

**Anchor-Based Tracking Innovation:**
- **Anchor Body**: Torso serves as reference frame
- **Relative Positioning**: All body poses computed relative to current anchor
- **Position Invariance**: Enables training across different starting positions
- **Yaw Alignment**: Preserves motion dynamics while allowing orientation flexibility

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```python
# From mdp/commands.py lines 240-245
delta_pos_w = robot_anchor_pos_w_repeat
delta_pos_w[..., 2] = anchor_pos_w_repeat[..., 2]  # Keep reference Z
delta_ori_w = yaw_quat(quat_mul(robot_anchor_quat_w_repeat, quat_inv(anchor_quat_w_repeat)))

self.body_quat_relative_w = quat_mul(delta_ori_w, self.body_quat_w)
self.body_pos_relative_w = delta_pos_w + quat_apply(delta_ori_w, self.body_pos_w - anchor_pos_w_repeat)
```

### 2. Reward Function Design

**Exponential Tracking Rewards:**
```python
# General form: r = exp(-error²/σ²)
motion_global_anchor_position_error_exp(σ=0.3)     # Global anchor position
motion_global_anchor_orientation_error_exp(σ=0.4)   # Global anchor orientation
motion_relative_body_position_error_exp(σ=0.3)      # Relative body positions
motion_relative_body_orientation_error_exp(σ=0.4)   # Relative body orientations
motion_global_body_linear_velocity_error_exp(σ=1.0) # Body velocities
motion_global_body_angular_velocity_error_exp(σ=3.14) # Angular velocities
```

**Regularization Terms:**
- Action rate penalty: -0.1 weight
- Joint limits penalty: -10.0 weight  
- Undesired contacts: -0.1 weight

### 3. PPO Training Configuration

**Network Architecture:**
- Actor: [512, 256, 128] hidden units, ELU activation
- Critic: [512, 256, 128] hidden units, ELU activation
- Observation noise injection for robustness

**Training Hyperparameters:**
- Rollout: 24 steps × 4096 environments = 98,304 samples
- Learning rate: 1e-3 with adaptive scheduling
- Epochs: 5, Mini-batches: 4
- Clipping: ε=0.2, Entropy: 0.005

## Training Workflow Detailed

### 1. Pre-Training Setup

**Motion Processing:**
```bash
# Convert CSV to NPZ with kinematic data
python scripts/csv_to_npz.py --input_file motion.csv --output_name motion_name
# Automatically uploads to WandB: 16726/csv_to_npz/motion_name:latest
# Links to registry: 16726-org/wandb-registry-Motions/motion_name
```

**Data Pipeline:**
1. LAFAN1 CSV → Forward Kinematics → NPZ format
2. Body positions, orientations, velocities computed
3. WandB artifact creation and registry linking
4. Motion available for training consumption

### 2. Training Execution

**Initialization Phase:**
```python
# Motion loading and environment setup
api = wandb.Api()
artifact = api.artifact(registry_name + ":latest")
motion_file = str(pathlib.Path(artifact.download()) / "motion.npz")
env_cfg.commands.motion.motion_file = motion_file
```

**Training Loop:**
1. **Environment Reset**: Random phase selection from motion
2. **Observation**: Robot state + motion command + anchor relative data
3. **Action**: Joint position targets from policy network
4. **Simulation**: Isaac Sim physics simulation step
5. **Reward**: Exponential tracking rewards + regularization
6. **Learning**: PPO update every 24 steps

### 3. Motion-Specific Learning Dynamics

**Phase Randomization:**
- Random starting points in motion sequence
- Pose perturbations: ±5cm position, ±0.1 rad orientation
- Velocity perturbations: ±0.5 m/s linear, ±0.78 rad/s angular

**Tracking Objectives:**
- Global anchor positioning and orientation
- Relative body transformations  
- Velocity matching for dynamic motions
- Smooth action transitions

    def __init__(self, motion_files: List[str], ...):
        self.motions = [MotionLoader(f, ...) for f in motion_files]
        self.current_motion_id = 0
    
    def sample_motion(self) -> int:
        # Motion selection strategy (uniform, curriculum, etc.)
        pass
```

**Enhanced Command System:**
```python
# Additional observation: motion identifier
motion_id_obs = torch.zeros(self.num_envs, len(self.motion_library))
motion_id_obs[env_ids, self.motion_ids[env_ids]] = 1.0

## Conclusion

BeyondMimic's current implementation is optimized for **single-motion expert training**, producing high-quality motion tracking policies. While the paper envisions multi-motion capabilities, the codebase requires extension to support unified multi-motion training. The current approach of training separate motion experts remains highly effective for applications requiring specific motion skills.

The framework's modular design and anchor-based tracking system provide excellent foundations for future multi-motion extensions, making BeyondMimic a powerful platform for both current single-motion applications and future multi-motion research.
