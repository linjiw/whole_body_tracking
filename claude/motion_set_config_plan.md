# Review of Fixes & Design for an Improved Motion Set Configuration

This document provides a review of the bug fixes in commits `51bd627b...` and `72f256c...` and presents a detailed design plan for a more elegant and practical system to configure multi-motion training experiments.

### 1. Review of Recent Fixes

Your recent commits successfully address the small but critical integration issues that arise after implementing a major feature. This is a sign of a healthy development process.

*   **Commit `51bd627b...`**: The fixes to f-string formatting, configuration validation (`motion_file` vs `motion_files`), and the ONNX exporter are all essential for making the new multi-motion feature robust and usable.
*   **Commit `72f256c...`**: The update to the `MotionOnPolicyRunner` to correctly handle comma-separated artifact names for WandB is an excellent and necessary fix for ensuring proper experiment tracking and reproducibility.

These changes demonstrate that the core multi-motion architecture is now stable and validated.

### 2. The Configuration Problem

The current method of running experiments by passing a long, comma-separated string of motion names to the command line (`--registry_name "motion1,motion2,..."`) has several drawbacks:

*   **Verbose & Error-Prone:** It's easy to make a typo in a long list of motions.
*   **Not Reusable:** Standard sets of motions (e.g., for testing locomotion) must be copied and pasted for each run.
*   **Poor Readability:** The command line doesn't clearly state the *purpose* of the experiment, only the raw data being used.
*   **Not Scalable:** It's difficult to manage dozens of motions or associate different training parameters with different sets of motions.

### 3. Design Plan: Motion Set Configuration Files

I propose a more elegant, practical, and scalable solution: **Motion Set Configuration Files**. This approach externalizes the definition of motion collections from the command line into reusable, version-controlled YAML files.

#### Step 1: Create a Motion Set Directory and Configuration Files

First, we will create a dedicated directory to store our motion set definitions.

1.  **Create New Directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p configs/motion_sets
    ```

2.  **Create YAML Configuration Files:** Inside `configs/motion_sets/`, create human-readable YAML files. Each file defines a logical grouping of motions.

    **Example: `configs/motion_sets/locomotion_basic.yaml`**
    ```yaml
    name: "Basic Locomotion"
    description: "A small set of basic walking and running motions for quick validation."
    motions:
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/walk1_subject1:latest"
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/walk3_subject2:latest"
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/run1_subject2:latest"
    ```

    **Example: `configs/motion_sets/dynamic_skills.yaml`**
    ```yaml
    name: "Dynamic Skills"
    description: "A set of highly dynamic and challenging motions for testing agility."
    motions:
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/dance1_subject1:latest"
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/jumps1_subject1:latest"
      - "16726/csv_to_npz/cristiano:latest"
    ```

#### Step 2: Update the Training Script to Use Motion Sets

Next, we will modify the main training script to understand and use these new configuration files.

1.  **Add `PyYAML` Dependency:** If not already installed, add `PyYAML` to your environment (`pip install pyyaml`).

2.  **Modify `scripts/rsl_rl/train.py`:**

    a. **Update Argument Parser:** We will add a new `--motion_set` argument and make the existing `--registry_name` optional. This provides a clean interface and maintains backward compatibility.

    ```python
    # In scripts/rsl_rl/train.py
    parser.add_argument("--motion_set", type=str, default=None, 
                       help="Name of a motion set YAML file in configs/motion_sets/ (e.g., 'locomotion_basic')")
    parser.add_argument("--registry_name", type=str, default=None, 
                       help="(Optional) Comma-separated list of motion registry names. Overrides --motion_set.")
    ```

    b. **Add Logic to Load the YAML Config:** In the `main()` function, before `load_motion_library` is called, add logic to process the new argument.

    ```python
    # In scripts/rsl_rl/train.py's main() function
    import yaml
    
    registry_names_str = args_cli.registry_name
    
    # If a motion set file is provided and registry_name is not, use the file
    if args_cli.motion_set and not registry_names_str:
        motion_set_name = args_cli.motion_set
        motion_set_path = os.path.join("configs", "motion_sets", motion_set_name)
        if not motion_set_path.endswith('.yaml'):
            motion_set_path += ".yaml"
        
        if not os.path.exists(motion_set_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Motion set file not found: {motion_set_path}")

        print(f"[INFO] Loading motion set from: {motion_set_path}")
        with open(motion_set_path, 'r') as f:
            motion_set_cfg = yaml.safe_load(f)
        
        registry_names_list = motion_set_cfg.get("motions", [])
        if not registry_names_list:
            raise ValueError(f"'motions' key not found or is empty in {motion_set_path}")
        
        registry_names_str = ",".join(registry_names_list)
        print(f"   > Loaded {len(registry_names_list)} motions for set: '{motion_set_cfg.get('name', motion_set_name)}'")

    if not registry_names_str:
        raise ValueError("A motion must be provided via --motion_set or --registry_name")

    # The rest of the script proceeds as before, using registry_names_str
    motion_files = load_motion_library(registry_names_str)
    # ...
    ```

### 4. New, More Elegant Workflow

With this new system, your experiment commands become much cleaner, more readable, and more powerful.

**To run an experiment with the basic locomotion set:**
```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --motion_set locomotion_basic
```

**To run an experiment with the dynamic skills set:**
```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --motion_set dynamic_skills
```

**To run a one-off experiment (maintaining backward compatibility):**
```bash
python scripts/rsl_rl/train.py --registry_name "16726/csv_to_npz/some_new_motion:latest"
```

### 5. Advantages of This Design

*   **Simplicity & Readability:** The command line clearly expresses the *intent* of the experiment.
*   **Reusability:** Standard motion sets can be defined once and reused by everyone on the team.
*   **Version Control:** Your experiment configurations (the motion sets) are now committed to Git, which is critical for reproducibility.
*   **Extensibility:** You can easily add new motion sets or even add new keys to the YAML files in the future (e.g., `hyperparameters: ...`) without breaking the existing workflow.
